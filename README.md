## ðŸŒŸ Air Pollution Predictor ðŸŒŸ

Through this repository, I showcase an advanced model designed to help city officials predict AQI (Air Quality Index) values and recommend necessary measures. The AQI is calculated based on several parameters, including:

- **PM2.5** (Particulate Matter 2.5)
- **PM10** (Particulate Matter 10)
- **NO2** (Nitrogen Dioxide)
- **SO2** (Sulfur Dioxide)
- **CO** (Carbon Monoxide)
- **O3** (Ozone)

### Impact ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’¡

This tool aims to enhance urban health and sustainability by providing accurate air quality forecasts and actionable insights. By predicting air quality, city officials can take proactive measures to reduce pollution levels, protect public health, and promote a cleaner environment. ðŸŒŸ
